### - Encryption is the process of scrambling or enciphering data so it can be read only by someone with the means to return it to its original state. It is a crucial feature of a safe and trustworthy Internet. It helps provide data security for sensitive information. 

### - Encryption is commonly used to protect data stored on computer systems and data transmitted via computer networks, including the Internet. Financial transactions and private messaging communications often use encryption to increase security. Encryption is important when we need to find out whether data has been tampered with (data integrity), to increase people’s confidence that they are communicating with the people they think are communicating with (authentication) and to be sure that messages were sent and received (non-repudiation).

## - Personal security
### Encryption is more important than ever as Internet-based crime is one of the fastest growing security threats. End-to-end encryption, the most secure form of encryption, ensures that sensitive, confidential information transmitted by billions of people online every day remains confidential and out of the hands of criminals.


## - National security
### End-to-end encryption helps prevent spies, terrorists, and hostile governments from accessing and exploiting confidential communications of government officials, and penetrating computer systems and databases that could cause wide-scale, systemic disruptions to economies, infrastructure, and security. 

### End-to-end encryption also protects the private, confidential communications of law enforcement, military personnel, government officials overseeing classified operations, and emergency responders. 

### Encryption also protects highly sensitive systems intrinsically tied to national security, including systems that power the electrical grid, databases containing confidential data on citizens, and databases of financial institutions critical to the economic stability of sovereign nations.

### The Diffie–Hellman (DH) Algorithm is a key-exchange protocol that enables two parties communicating over public channel to establish a mutual secret without it being transmitted over the Internet. DH enables the two to use a public key to encrypt and decrypt their conversation or data using symmetric cryptography.

### Diffie-Helman is generally explained by two sample parties, Alice and Bob, initiating a dialogue. Each has a piece of information they want to share, while preserving its secrecy. To do that they agree on a public piece of benign information that will be mixed with their privileged information as it travels over an insecure channel. Their secrets are mixed with the public information, or public key, and as the secrets are exchanged the information they want to share is commingled with the common secret. As they decipher the other’s message, they can extract the public information and with knowledge of their own secret, deduce the new information that was carried along. While seemingly uncomplicated in this method’s description, when long number strings are used for private and public keys, decryption by an outside party trying to eavesdrop is mathematically infeasible even with considerable resources.

## Example:
### "The two are communicating over an open network using Diffie–Hellman encryption, so hackers or others seeking to eavesdrop or intercept a message are unlikely to break the encryption, even with considerable resources."
